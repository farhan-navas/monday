## App Introduction

So we had JARVIS then we had FRIDAY and now we have MONDAY. For now Monday does
not do much here's a quick list of stuff i want to integrate with. This is app is mainly
built for iOS as I use iOS and this app is just for me for now. I am first going to create
the UI to practise and then I am gonna move on with actually adding functionality. Backend
to store data will be added one day probably with .NET and C# as I like it. I also want to
add actual Swift code instead of only coding in Dart but we shall see hehe

MONDAY SPEC LIST UI:

This is just for me to get more hands on with Flutter UI components not really the main focus
of the app to build a nice UI but it will be nice to learn abit, so I might just add in random
extra pages wherever I want to!

- [x] Weather display based on geographic location
- [x] Task manager, kind of like a todo list
- [ ] Health dashboard + Sleep dashboard + Screentime dashboard
- [ ] User details dashboard
- [ ] Pricing Page, just UI does not do anything

FUNCTIONALITY

- [ ] Some cool integrations that I want to integrate:
  - [ ] Calendar (my main one so that its kind of like motion but free for me hehe)
  - [ ] Settings, but just for ScreenTime API tbh
  - [ ] SIRIKIT, this would be so cool, but I have no idea
  - [ ] Apple Health, sleep + health data connected
  - [ ] Apple Intelligence API, prep for the future when it is actually good
  - [ ] Some LLM endpoint maybe DeepSeek to help me handle things like calendar and all that,
        all data still stored locally but ofc if use deepseek api they have your data
  - [ ] SG Parking API, when you ask Monday for parking instantly pulls up maps to guide you there
- [ ] Local only 'Memories' storage
- [ ] Ability to login with Apple/Google/MS account, and provide functionality to be able to export
